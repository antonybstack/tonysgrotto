This is a web app ive been developing for fun that contains an unorganized collection of cool features and tools

**MERN Stack** - MongoDB ExpressJS ReactJS NodeJS

As recommended by the React Core Team, this react app tries to use function components only. Out with the old, in with the new!

Quote from my reddit post:
We (React team) are working to rewrite our docs to be more function/hooks focused this quarter! Rachel (Nabors) and Dan are the primary people working on this...Function components and hooks are the way of the future" -react core team

### Current features

- a bug tracker. CRUD opertions with database
- real time chat and users online list. Implemented using socket-io and MongoDB
- react-bootstrap styling
