This is a web app ive been developing for fun that contains an unorganized collection of cool features and tools

**MERN Stack** - MongoDB ExpressJS ReactJS NodeJS

### Current features

- a bug tracker. CRUD opertions with database are real time, and implemented using only react's context and state (without using sockets which I think is really cool. And it seems to render data changes faster than websockets would)
